Please do keep me updated on the connection progress.\n\nI completely respect Mark's privacy, but given the importance of Lucas's safety and well-being, is there any way to encourage Mark to consent to sharing his diagnosis with me? Understanding this is key to providing the best care and support for both Mark and Lucas. Any guidance on this would be deeply appreciated."

                "message": "Hi Emily, I understand the importance of Lucas's safety and well-being, and encouraging Mark to share his diagnosis is indeed a sensitive but important issue. When discussing this with Mark, it's crucial to be patient, respectful, and non-judgmental. Emphasize that your motivation is to provide the best support for both him and Lucas, and reassure him that his feelings and privacy will be respected.\n\nOpen, honest, and empathetic communication can help build trust over time. Avoid pressuring him and allow him to share at his own pace. Sometimes, expressing your own concerns and feelings honestly but gently can encourage openness.\n\nIf safety concerns arise, it's important to prioritize professional intervention promptly.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further guidance or support."

Your attentiveness and care are crucial during this time."
