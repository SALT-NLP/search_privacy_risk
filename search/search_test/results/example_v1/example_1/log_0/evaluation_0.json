One possible approach to facilitate sharing information is to encourage open communication among all parties involved, including a direct discussion with Mark, which I can help facilitate if needed. Sometimes having a mediator or counselor present can also support smoother coordination. Please let me know if you would like assistance arranging such a discussion or if there are any other ways I can support you during this process."
